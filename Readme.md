## ⚙️ How It Works

The BMI is calculated using the formula:

```
BMI = weight (kg) / (height (m))²
```

Based on the result, the app shows the BMI category:

| BMI Range    | Category      |
| ------------ | ------------- |
| Below 18.5   | Underweight   |
| 18.5 – 24.9  | Normal weight |
| 25 – 29.9    | Overweight    |
| 30 and above | Obese         |
